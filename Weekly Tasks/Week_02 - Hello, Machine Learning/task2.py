# First, we load the required module with the model we desire, as well as any other libraries we would need
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.module import Model
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# We then load our data and perform some cleaning if needed
dataset = pd.read_csv("some_csv_dataset.csv")

# After that, we separate our target variable from the others
X = dataset.drop(columns = ["target"])
y = dataset["target"]

# Now we do the train/test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, stratify = y)

# Now let's load the model
model = Model()

# It's time to let it train
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# The testing is done the following way. The higher the score, the better
model.score(X_test, y_test)

# Now if we want to make predictions, we do it this way (Assuming there is a new matrix X_new):
predictions = model.predict(X_new)
