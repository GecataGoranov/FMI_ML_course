This repository contains all of the coursework I have done for the "Machine Learning" course I took in uni. Here you can find 2 homework assignmens, as well as all of the weekly exercises I have done. Below is a Binder button, where all of the files can be accessed via Jupyter Notebook (recommended for the homeworks, not for the weekly tasks).
